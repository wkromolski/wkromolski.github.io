## HELL IS IMPURE!
<br>
Literally. It's such a mess that the most
famous tour guides, Dante and Virgil, have no
choice but to strike a pact with this new guy,
Faust.
In this quirky game, you don’t battle demons.
Instead, you show mercy to the poor damned
souls by ensuring they can be punished in a
clean environment! Program the route for the
Rumba to tidy up all the dirt, making sure it
doesn’t fall into the abyss or get stuck under
the furniture.
But is it really the only afterworld that needs
cleaning? Let’s make Hell pure again and see
what other realms await!

<b> 4 people’s academic project, currently I'm working on. 
I'm responsible for all models, look of game levels, animations, particle systems and VFXs. 
There are plans to continue developing the game after passing the course. </b>
