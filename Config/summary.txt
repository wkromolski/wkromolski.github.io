I’m a 3rd-year student of Game Development at Collegium Da Vinci University in Poznań.
The visual aspect of games has always been what I paid attention to so at some point in my life I decided to follow the path of a 3D artist, focused on hardsuface modelling.
I actively participate in the development of university game related projects that are part of classes, always trying to do my best.
I am a responsible and conscientious person, as well as full of desire to develop and learn new things. I am distinguished by self-reliance and assertiveness, I always try to think critically and learn from my mistakes.
