## My role

Initially production started as a four-person project for academic course purposes. 
As time passed, it became a personal activity. 
We decided to finish it after completing the course and try to publish it. 
Currently, we are working on Dante’s Rumba as a team of six people.

<br>
<br>

At first, my main focus for this project was creating all the models, as visually coherent as possible, forming the basis for a simple, stylized art style.
My main reference was the game Tools Up!, however, while maintaining own graphic style.

<br>
<br>

Furthermore I created needed particle effects, shader graphs and idle animations.

## HELL IS IMPURE!
 - if you wanna read more about the project :)

<br>
<br>

Literally. It's such a mess that the most
famous tour guides, Dante and Virgil, have no
choice but to strike a pact with this new guy,
Faust.
In this quirky game, you don’t battle demons.
Instead, you show mercy to the poor damned
souls by ensuring they can be punished in a
clean environment! Program the route for the
Rumba to tidy up all the dirt, making sure it
doesn’t fall into the abyss or get stuck under
the furniture.
But is it really the only afterworld that needs
cleaning? Let’s make Hell pure again and see
what other realms await!

<br>
<br>

It all began with a few words: "Devilish Roomba" and
"Divine Comedy".
And thus, the game unfolds in the Nine Circles of Hell,
drawing inspiration from Dante Alighieri’s vision but
infused with a modern touch.

<br>
<br>

The player explores these circles progressively, completing levels along
the way. You assume the role of Faust, one of the newest damned souls. In
addition to planning routes for the Rumba, you embark on a personal
journey, the profundity of which is determined by your choices. While the
main game can be completed without delving into Faust's story, engaging
with the dialogues of the damned souls encountered along the way
reveals hidden richness in the overall experience. You might discover
how, in the depths of Hell, Virgil’s soul found itself trapped in a broken
robot and uncover what Faust truly seeks to achieve.
