## My role

Initially production started as a four-person project for academic course purposes. 
As time passed, it became a personal activity. 
We decided to finish it after completing the course and try to publish it. 
Currently, we are working on Danteâ€™s Rumba as a team of six people.

At first, my main focus for this project was creating all the models, as visually coherent as possible, forming the basis for a simple, stylized art style.
My main reference was the game Tools Up!, however, while maintaining own graphic style.

<br>

Furthermore I created needed particle effects, shader graphs and idle animations.
