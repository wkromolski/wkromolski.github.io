Rune Rock
---
Small academic project which I was doing in 3D classes. 
Our topic was to make Magic Rock/Rune Rock with our interpretation and idea. 
From the start I wanted to make it stylized and present it in the environment created by myself. Big thanks to https://www.artstation.com/akbutea for an incredible tutorial on how to make awesome stylized grass. RuneRock was made in ZBrush | Smaller rocks, tree, grass and flowers in Blender | Textured in Substance Painter | Rendered in Unreal Engine 5
